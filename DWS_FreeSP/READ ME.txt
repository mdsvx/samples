Hello,

Derik White here introducing the FreeSP sample pack.

These are a collection of various virtual instrument drum hits sampled through an SP1200 drum  machine. 

You can use these freely in your music and production, but you are not allowed to redistribute the sounds or sell the sounds.

Thanks and enjoy.
